Assignment 1:
The AsteriskPyramid program uses nested for loops to ultimately determine the pattern
to display, depending on the number of lines the user decides to input. Ologn^2 is the big O-notation for this program.
Also, I learned to pay particular attention to the use of spaces, which ultimately affects how much of the pyramid is shifted
once displayed.how much the pyramid is displayed.
